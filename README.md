## Dataset

We are using the [Gun Violence Database](http://gun-violence.org/). The database will include information on from the dates, locations and times of shootings, to details on the victims and the shooters. 

## Relevance 

With the recent uproar over the Parkland shooting, we wanted to investigate if there were any patterns to shootings.

## Aim


## No User Interaction

The website would display a heat map of gun violence by state.

## User Interaction

The user would be able to click on states and view the information more indepth. It would also be possible to see the breakdown of the victims and shooters.

## Questions

We were curious if there existed any patterns such as one between a state and the frequency of gun violence.
