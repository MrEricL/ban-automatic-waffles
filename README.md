# Data visualization project

## Dataset

We are using the [Gun Violence Database](http://gun-violence.org/). The database will include information on from the dates, locations and times of shootings, to details on the victims and the shooters. 

## Relevance 

With the recent uproar over the Parkland shooting, we wanted to investigate if there were any patterns to shootings, from gender fatalities/shooters to race fatalities/shooters to age fatalities/shooters.

## Aim

We plan to show the amount of gun violence per state via something similar to a heat map, and we plan to show racial, gender, and age breakdowns of both shooters and victims either through transitioning graphs or with a similar heat map.

## No User Interaction

The website would display a heat map of gun violence by state with various buttons to show transitioning maps/graphs.

## User Interaction

The user would be able to click on states and view the information more indepth. It would also be possible to see the breakdown of the victims and shooters, and transition between different graphs of general gun violence, racial breakdowns, age breakdowns, and gender breakdowns.

## Questions

We were curious if there existed any patterns such as one between a state and the frequency of gun violence as well as between a state and the frequency of a particular race being the victim/shooter or gender being the victim/shooter.


## d3 Usage

We plan to use d3 to create animated transitions between graphs as well as to create the graphs/heatmaps themselves.


## Credits

We are using the US map from [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/a74faf20b492ad377312) as a base.
